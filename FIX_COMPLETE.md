# Logo CSS Import Fix Complete âœ…

## Issue
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/app/s/[subdomain]/themes/commerce/sections/logo.css'
```

## Fix Applied
Changed the import in `/themes/commerce/blocks/logo-block.tsx`:

**Before:**
```typescript
import '@/app/s/[subdomain]/themes/commerce/sections/logo.css';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import '../sections/logo.css';
```

## Verification
- The CSS file exists at: `/themes/commerce/sections/logo.css`
- No other similar import issues found
- Using relative import path instead of absolute path with dynamic segments

The build error should now be resolved. Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` to verify.
